# Documentation: Scripts

These scripts perform tasks that are either difficult or impossible to do with other tools.

**mk_nginx_ami.sh**: Create an AMI image from the instance created by template ```cf04.yaml```.

**stopstart.sh**: Turn development infrastructure on or off to contain costs, without needing to delete and recreate it.
